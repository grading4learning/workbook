## Getting Started Questions

```{dropdown} Can these principles apply to my subject area?

Yes! We have spoken with faculty in several areas of humanities and STEM who have adopted some form of alternative grading whether it be using badges, competency-based grading, specifications-grading, combos of these and others.
```

```{dropdown} Will applying these principles make grading take more time?

Nope! When done correctly these can even minimize the amount you spend grading!
```

```{dropdown} Are these practices evidence-based?

A lot of them are! For more info, check out our [resources page](../resources/resources)
```

```{dropdown} How long does it take for students to understand and get used to alternative grading schemes?

It depends on whether they've had another class with alternative grading or not as well as how well and often you remind students of the grading scheme/policy. We recommend explaining the scheme in detail in the syllabus, briefly in class at the beginning of the semester, and once again more in-depth halfway through the semester (once students have experienced it for a few assignments, more questions pop up).
```

```{dropdown} How have students adapted to these new systems? I’m concerned that all of these different grading systems will make the students confused/anxious.

There will be understandable anxiety and confusion, especially at the beginning. Humans struggle with change and we fear the unfamiliar. However, most students will recognize and appreciate the value of these new systems. We recommend explaining the scheme in detail in the syllabus, briefly in class at the beginning of the semester, and once again more in-depth halfway through the semester (once students have experienced it for a few assignments, more questions pop up).
```

```{dropdown} How much pushback should I expect from students?

Humans struggle with change and we fear the unfamiliar. Explaining to students the motivation behind these principles and sharing resources with them will be important to appeasing their concerns. Generally speaking, students tend to notice that these policies and grading schemes feel more equitable and less stressful which helps them feel cared for and as such they are motivated and appreciative.

## Logistics Questions

```{dropdown} My LMS doesn't support alternative grading structures.

There are some workarounds. For example, in [Victoria's web dev course](../cases/web-dev), all assignments were unweighted and worth only 1 point. The final grade calculation was points earned divided by total possible points. Similar grading can also be calculated via a spreadsheet and then current final grades can be imported to your LMS. Speaking to your IT office or LMS support team may prove beneficial for workarounds or tips and tricks!
```

```{dropdown} My LMS doesn't support peer-grading.

Someone suggested using Google Doc peer-review rubrics: students make a copy of the original and then share the link with the student they're reviewing. However, that format doesn't allow anonymous peer-grading. A workaround would be to use student IDs and have students post their links as part of a discussion board assignment. Speaking to your LMS support team may prove beneficial for workarounds or tips and tricks!
```

```{dropdown} How can I apply these principles while using automated grading?

It depends on which principles you're interested in applying but generally speaking, you'll most likely have to rethink each assignment's grade breakdown and the way that's displayed/communicated to students. [Victoria's data structures course](../cases/data-structs-comp) utilized an automated grader with a competency-based grading scheme.
```

```{dropdown} When resubmissions are allowed, how much feedback fo you provide?

When grading manually, focusing on big issues that they could work on rather than nitty gritty is beneficial. When using and automated grader, having distinct test cases separated by themes can be helpful.
```

```{dropdown} Does allowing resubmissions or flexible deadlines mean more grading? Are there a lot of last minute submissions?

In Victoria's experience, not much. There are always a couple students who will submit all their assignments within the last week of courses but for the most part, students submit their work in waves. With resubmissions, if you have clear feedback as to what is missing and what was present, re-grading can be a quick check of missing reqs. 
```

```{dropdown}  What is the trade off of extra flexibility and allowing continual re-submissions. Will this set a precedent that students expect all deadlines and work can be flexible or changed? Do you think not having deadlines or having flexible deadlines negatively impacts them in the real world where they need to meet deadlines in their jobs?


We live in a world that could use a little more kindness, especially in these trying times. We have long told students "in college your professors won't..." or "in the workplace your boss won't.." when the reality of it is: Life Happens. Things come up whether you're a student, an academic, blue-collar, or white-collar. Integrating flexibility allows for equity-- we're not doing our students a favor-- we're recognizing that they are whole human beings with lives and responsibilities outside of our own course that will sometimes take priority over our assignments, and that's okay.
