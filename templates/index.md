# Templates and Guided Practice

This section of the workbook is designed to support you in applying the concepts from the workshop to your own course. First, decide if you will revise assignments but keep the scheme or focus on revising the grading scheme and policies and have assignments follow.


Then you can choose any of the templates or guided design documents in this section to follow.  You can work in markdown in the workbook or in another place you prefer to work.
