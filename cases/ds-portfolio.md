# Assignment: Data Science Portfolio

[live site](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall20/portfolio/)

```{note}

Students submitted their portfolio as a jupyter book via GitHub classroom.  They added more content to the same repository over the course of the semester.

## Prompts

### Overall

The prompts provide a starting point, but remember that to earn achievements, you’ll be evaluated by the rubric. You can see the full rubric for all portfolios in the syllabus. Your portfolio is also an opportunity to be creative, explore things, and answer your own questions that we haven’t answered in class to dig deeper on the topics we’re covering. Use the feedback you get on assignments to inspire your portfolio.

Each submission should include an introduction and a number of ‘chapters’. The grade will be based on both that you demonstrate skills through your chapters that are inspired by the prompts and that your summary demonstrates that you know you learned the skills. See the formatting tips for advice on how to structure files.

### Correct an Assignment

Choose an assignment that you did not achieve the target level for. Write a blog style notebook analysis that corrects what you could have done better, what you learned, and addresses the misconception if applicable.

```{note}
To get credit for this, student had to not only correct, but truly reflect and explain.
```


### Deeper Analysis

For one of the assignments, if there was something you were curious about. Try it out and investigate how to answer it. Vary parameters and document your investigation.

### New Analysis

For  a topic of interest, clean, explore and model the data. Work with messy data or data provided in multiple files to earn prepare and construct achievements or use clean data to earn only EDA and modeling achievements.

### CheatSheet

Make a cheatsheet with examples of the several different parameter settings for common operations for one topic.

This cheatsheet is an example, it’s too broad, but it’s the same idea. Yours should cover one topic in greater detail and demonstrate your skill according to the rubric.
