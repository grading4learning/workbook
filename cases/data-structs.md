The **Spring 2021** course uses a competency-based grading scheme and assesses assignments on specification against an assignment rubric. The **Summer 2021** course uses a specifications grading scheme and assesses assignments on complete/incomplete basis. 


## Differences across semesters
In the Spring version of the course, I used competency-based grading wherein students were expected to reach a minimum level of knowledge (classified as **understanding**) for a specific set of topics covered in the course. Some topics were required, others served almost as a bonus that would allow students to increase their overall course grade. The grading scheme was then updated for the Summer course to specifications grading, which required a minimum of a fully functional solution for any set of topics, the number of said topics to be chosen by the student, based on the grade they were hoping to achieve (a minimum of 14 fully functional solutions was required to pass the course).

## Instructor Process

### Spring Process
The course covers a very large number of topics over a 13 week period, several of which previous instructors didn't get to as students fell behind throughout the semester. I decided to pick the most important topics and classified them as non-negotiables-- these were topics a student shouldn't leave a data structures and algo course without understanding. I chose to have 4 levels of knowledge, of which the highest required a self-directed final project to demonstrate. I categorized the original assignment requirements into the three levels of knowledge left, and that became that assignment's rubric. 

A concrete example using writing: Say the learning objective of the assignment is to write a paragraph. To reach awareness, a student would have to write between 3-5 sentences total. To reach this level of knowledge (awareness) students don't have to worry too much about the sentences flowing well and being related, they just have to meet the bare minimum of length. To demonstrate understanding, the 3-5 sentences must be on the same topic, and lastly, to demonstrate competency, students would have to write 3-5 sentences about the same topic, that flow well together, and form a unified single idea. 

### Summer Process
While students enjoyed a grading structure that centered learning and offered them flexibility, having topics that mattered more for their final grade created unnecessary confusion so I decided to change the grading scheme to specifications grading for the summer. For the summer, I kept assignment requirements as-is. Each assignment became complete/incomplete and the only way to complete any given assignment was by meeting ALL requirements. Final course grades were based on the total number of completed assignments, with a minimum of 14 being required to pass with a D (for reference there were around 21 total assignments given out). 


## System basics

### Spring (competency-based grading) Basics
Almost each grade band (A, B, and C) had two options/avenues to be earned (D only had one path). One of the options offered more flexibility for missing or incomplete assingments, the other did not. Final projects were an optional way to demonstrate knowledge to give students who missed any assignments an additional opportunity to boost their grade. Completing and submitting a final project was also required to earn an A in the course. There was also an opportunity to gain a + designation described in the syllabus (i.e., to get a B+ instead of a B).

### Summer (specifications grading) Basics
Students had to meet all the requirements (I used an autograder so they had to pass all the autograder tests) of: 
- 14-15 assignments to earn a D
- 16-17 assignments to earn a C
- 18-19 assignments to earn a B
- 20+ assignments to earn an A

For reference, there were a total of 21 graded/qualified assignments. Completing and submitting a final project was also a required part of passing the course. Final projects didn't count towards a student's final grade, though an exemplar final project could earn a student a + designation (i.e., a B+ instead of a B). There was an additional opportunity to gain a + designation described in the syllabus, as well as a way to earn a "freebie" (replace a mising or incomplete assignment). 

## Equity and learning focus

### Spring (competency-based grading) 
- Final course grades were not based on averaging performance across assignments meaning students could have bad weeks that wouldn't hurt their final grade.  
- Students had multiple opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge in any given topic area.

### Summer (specifications grading) 
- Final course grades were not based on averaging performance across assignments meaning students could have bad weeks that wouldn't hurt their final grade.  
- Students had the agency to choose which and how many assignments to complete.

### Other applied strategies for equity
- Assignment resubmissions were allowed and encouraged throughout the semester. Some topics take longer than others to click, sometimes students have only a limited amount of time to devote to an assignment but can return to it later.
- Soft deadlines and hard deadlines allowed students to self-pace while having an outline of where they should be at with their assignment completion.
- Open-ended final projects to allow students to apply course topics to their own interests.
