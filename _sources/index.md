# Centering Learning and Equity in Assessment Workbook

This workbook is designed for the Tapia 2021 Workshop facilitated by Sarah M Brown and Victoria Chávez.

In this workshop, we will discuss assessment from the assignment level to the course level that aligns with learning and equity. We will first out key terms, show how assessment can encourage learning and support equity. Next, participants will practice applying the new terminology and theoretical grounding by studying examples.  Finally, participants will get to revise materials for their own courses.
