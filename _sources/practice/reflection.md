# Reflection

After receiving feedback, it's good practice to reflect on what we've changed and what we've learned before piling on more changes. As questions come up, we should also do our due diligence to have those questions answered by our peers, others who have done similar work, or teaching adn learning experts at our institution's center for teaching and learning.


> Workshop Attendees: As a whole group, we will take about 15 minutes to reflect on your modifications, the feedback received, and the questions you have for moving forward. Presenters will pose reflective exercises and answer participants’ questions.

Reflective Questions to Consider:

1. What are your overall thoughts on starting these revisions?
1. How was the peer review? Did you learn something helpful?
1. What is the one most important change you plan to make to your course based on the workshop today?
1. What questions or concerns do you have?
1. Are there any 'blocks' preventing you from making updates to your course(s)?
