# Using Case Studies

The **Case Studies** section contains examples of assignments and (the grading section of) syllabi that demonstrate some principles for grading that support learning and equity.  

> Workshop Attendees: In your breakout group, take about 15 minutes to discuss one assignment and one grading scheme. 

For each case study, answer the following questions:

1. Which principle(s) are applied?
1. How is the principle you identified applied?
1. What do you like about this case?
1. What would you want to change?
1. What questions do you have about case study?
