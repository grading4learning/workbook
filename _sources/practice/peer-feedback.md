# Peer Feedback

Peer feedback is crucial in course development and refinement. Your peers may notice or think about things you haven't considered and they may have resources or advice to share!


> Workshop Attendees: In your breakout group, take about 10 minutes to take turns describing the changes you've started working on, the questions or concerns you have, and providign feedback for your peers. If you're able to share your work via a link, file, or screenshare, please do so. Provide any feedback or advice you think will be most useful for your peers.
Make sure to keep it concise so everyone is able to share!
