This course uses a competency-based grading scheme and assesses assignments on
specification agains an overall course rubric.

## Instructor Process

I broke down the course learning outcomes into 15 component skills and wrote three
outcomes for each describing a skill acquisition expected for each skill. This
describes each of the 45 (15*3) achievements that constitute the students' grades.



## System basics

To earn an A required all 45 achievements, a B required all level 1 and level 2
achievements, a C required all level 1 achievements.
Students could earn level 1 achievements in any activity: class participation,
weekly programming assignments, or a portfolio submitted 4 times through the semester.  
Level 2 achievements could be earned only on assignments and portfolio checks.  
Level 3 achievements could only be earned on portfolio checks.  

In class questions checked basic understanding through multiple choice questions
and short programming problems.  These were cumulative only, not graded as a
percentage correct.  Assignments were designed to assess level 2 achievements,
such that each skill was assessed in at least two assignments. Portfolios were
open ended, encouraging students to use general prompts to explore the material
deeper than was covered in class, guided by the level 3 achievement definitions.

## Equity and learning focus

The grade was not based on averaging performance across activities; the basis
was the material only.  Students had at least 2 chances (and mostly many more)
to earn every single achievement.  A student could require 2 attempts at every
single achievement and still earn an A. Students could skip assignments as they
deemed necessary for their regular schedule.  Because the grade was cumulative,
students focused on their learning; gradin was that they had to demonstrate
understanding: both applying material and communicating well enough.
