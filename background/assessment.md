# Introduction

Assessment can have a big impact on our students.

- They seem to make students approach assignments as a formula rather than a learning experience.
- We use rubrics but even with them I find nuance difficult to convey
- My goal is to provide valuable feedback without it consuming my life.
- I believe in a lot of no risk writing and homework assignments, and give students opportunities to revise and rewrite graded work for a new grade after discussion and feedback with me.
-  I would love for learning in my classes to come more from intrinsic motivation, so finding a way to change the grading system in that direction (if possible!)
- I want to give students opportunities to try multiple times, to learn and revise, without the  grading being too onerous for me.
-  I want to shift student’s goal of getting a good grade to learning to their potential. How can we address grading so that it isn’t the focal point of the goal.
- My students experience me taking too long to mark their work—I want to speed it up, so my feedback arrives in a timely fashion and is more useful to them.
- Want to find out about new ways students can learn from my grading efforts.
- I am interested in providing valuable feedback to students without a whole lot of additional time spent on grading, especially since I teach large classes. I also find it very problematic to put students in the particular boxes as conventional grading schemes seem to do. Not everyone starts at the same point, and I’d like to grade the improvement, rather than levels!
- I find that numerous grade-points (which help soften the importance of each individual evaluation) tends to flatten “the curve” making it harder to get, for example, a solid A which ambitious students are “trained” to pursue at all costs.
- Strategies like minimal marking create more equitable working conditions for faculty, particularly PTF, in our program. Better, more equitable working conditions are directly correlated to better learning conditions for our students.
- students learn in different ways and have different strengths. They should be able to show they have met the objectives through different means that work with their strengths . A student may not do well with taking tests, but is competent with the material and could show that in other ways.
- grading could be equitable if faculty could keep in mind different students learning styles and background knowledge. give students with less background more chances to improve.
-  A pro of the rubric system is that I spend approx the same time/effort reviewing each student’s work so that is equitable from a faculty-to-student contact standpoint
- “grading” needs to be aligned as closely as possible with our goals for equitable learning.  Changing our goals without changing some of our highest-impact practices makes little sense.
- But that we need to find a way to integrate the two since grades are a current requirement of the larger educational system
- Students who come from backgrounds where they have received less support or training in basic writing skills, for example, are automatically at a disadvantage when it comes to traditional grading in college. Then this compounds, as they receive poor grades, their self-esteem lowers, they cannot get the same opportunities as students with higher grades, and this exacerbates equity concerns
-  Need to be very careful about what I think of as common knowledge and how it is incorporated into content and assessment. 
- I think giving honest feedback helps everyone achieve.
- grading is a major teaching tool as well as assessment.  All should benefit if exams are constructed correctly.
- let’s students understand their progress
- Grading can be reflective of what we've actually been able to cover
- Retention of material and putting the time in 
- Need to giver reasonable feedback
- Having broad, flexible, and transparent grading practices allows for a range of learning styles, while still allowing a fair assessment of learning goals.
- Equitable teaching to me means that I am working with students both individually and as a group. I hope that I can grade on the growth of the student rather than compliance behaviors.
- students learn in different ways and vary greatly in their experience and comfort level with the various modes of assessment. If we are able to achieve equitable learning outcomes through revision of our assessment tools - that would be equitable for all students.
- Creating solid procedural justice so that you can grade with minimum bias. So hard to achieve that transparacy
- Grading sometimes reflects what students are already able to do as opposed to what they are actually learning: reinforces the differences students are already coming in with
