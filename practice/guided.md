This section of the workbook is designed to support you in applying the principles discussed previously to your own course(s).

> Workshop Attendees: Take about 10 minutes to complete the steps below. **Please keep your work in an virtually-shareable format.** In the next part of the workshop, you will receive and provide peer feedback.

1. Decide if you will revise assignments but keep your grading scheme **or** will focus on revising your grading scheme and policies and have assignments follow.
    - Keep in mind that revising your grading scheme will most likely mean eventually having to modify each assignment's grade breakdown for it to make sense with the overall scheme. 
1. Choose any of the templates or guided design documents under the **Templates** section. 
    - Make sure to keep notes for yourself as well as a before and after copy of your syllabus and/or assignment(s).
1. Consider 1-2 questions or concerns you have to focus your peer feedback so that it's the most helpful.
